### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Ahmet Kenar, an enthusiastic self-taught and self-motivated Javascript web and mobile developer. The main technologies that I have been mostly using are React and React Native. I have been working as a freelancer mobile and web developer for 2 years. I am not afraid of challenges, they motivates me and push me to learn every day.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as primary react native developer of London-based startup, TheList (formerly Mammalo). Here are the links of the app on both [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1288061045) and [Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mammalo.app)
